# Ntuple History

## v45

* Final version with VVTight τ ID

## v44

* Botched attempt to correct v43

## v43

* Add VVTight to IDs

## v42

* Activate JEC correctly

## v41

* Another HLT-rerun

## v40

* Fix HLT results for amc@NLO samples (different InputTag)

## v39

* Updated systematics for amc@NLO

## v38

* Re-RECO, Moriond17 event selection with new lepton MVA

## v37

* Re-RECO, new b-tag cuts

## v36

* Garbage

## v35

* Non-re-reco datasets

## v34

* Ntuple post sync
* Flat structure, no more combinations

## v33

* Garbage

## v32

* Run with 80X triggers

## v31

* Intermediate run synced on 80X for lepton ID (not event-variables)

## v30

* Lepton counts in selection are for loose leptons
  * preselected leptons are a superset of loose leptons
  * for TTL/LJ lepton id, loose leptons are identical preselected leptons
* Save the lepton, τ id in the combination to select the right one easier

## v29

* Tighter skim for TLL

## v28

* New output structure with FWLite ntuples

## v27

* ¿Various improvements?

## v26

* As v25, but done right with Lobster

## v25

* More τ selection bugfixes, with CRAB

## v24

* Same as v23, but processed with CRAB

## v23

* Bugfixes for τ selection

## v22

* Same as v21, but processed with CRAB

## v21

* First 76X ntuple version

## v20

* Restrict to two τs again

## v19

* Use silver JSON

## v18

* Actually allow more than 2 b-tags

## v17

* Same as v16, but run with CRAB, to see if Lobster is processing datasets
  wrong

## v16

* Yet more sync stuff
* Ran with 0-2 τ per combination to compare to lepton+jets

## v15

* Sync data sample setup with the ttH→bb group
* Fixes JER/JES for data

## v14

* Run with new globaltags
* Includes new JER/JES
* Switch e MVA ID over to yet another producer

## v13

* Run with LJ sync config, too see where the e/μ mismodelling comes from

### v13.1

* Apply tighter jet cuts

## v12

* Synced with ttH Lepton+Jets

  * new electron ID
  * lower μ pt cuts

### v12.1

* Better τ gen-matching resulting in higher efficiency

## v11

### v11.1

* τ raw isolation w/ 3 hits
* τ generator level visible pt

### v11.2

* More powheg samples

# Training Ntuple History

## v4

* Moriond17 event selection with updated lepton MVA

## v3

* New b-tag cuts

## v2

* Full FastSim stats

## v1

* Basic version of FastSim
